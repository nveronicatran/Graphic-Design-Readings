<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This is the home of references for a research project by Veronica Tran completed at IaaC / Elisava under the 'Masters in Design for Emergent Futures'. The project aims to challenge perspectives on ubiquitous informational structures in the urban context, and ‘immaterial’ technology using cultural and material practices. Invisible exchanges of information and technology has developed faster than the social ability to synthesize it, from air pollution to city wide flows of electromagnetic waves. Responding to urban change demands literacy in technology, particularly data technologies, the project hence focuses on addressing the physicality and sensorial elements of urban data.

<h3>On Museums</h3>
<p>Museums as institutions have stayed static the world around us has radically shifted. Spaces that aestheticize and embody the interaction between people and information. A ‘museum without walls’, a phrase that dates back to Andre Malraux, and the potential of a distributed, internationalist museum ‘collection of collections’ becomes more possible now with digital technologies. How do we read the city, how does the city read us, and how do we make sense of each other? What are the new ways to write our urban data and cultural history and how can we equip people for that?
